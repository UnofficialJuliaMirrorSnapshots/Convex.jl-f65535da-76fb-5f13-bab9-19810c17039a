Optimizing in a Loop
=====================================

Memory Management
*****************

Convex uses a module-level dictionary to store the conic forms of every
variable and expression created in the same Julia session.
These variables and expressions persist even after they are out of scope.
If you create large numbers of variables inside a loop, this 
dictionary can eat a considerable amount of memory.

To flush the memory, you can call
::
	Convex.clearmemory()

This will remove every variable and expression you've formed before
from the memory cache, so that you're starting as fresh as if you'd just
reimported Convex.

Caching Expressions
*******************

Better yet, take advantage of this cache of variables and expressions!
Create variables and expressions outside the loop, and reuse them
inside the loop as you tweak parameters. Doing this will allow Convex
to reuse the conic forms it has already calculated for previously used expressions.

For example, the following **bad** code will create a new instance of a variable 
and of the expression :code:`square(x)` for each value of :code:`i`.
Don't do this:
::
	for i=1:10
		x = Variable()
		p = minimize(square(x), x >= i)
		solve!(p, SCSSolver())
	end

Contrast this with the following **good** code, which 
will reuse the cached conic form for :code:`square(x)` for each :code:`i`,
reducing the memory footprint and speeding up the computation.
Do this instead:
::
	x = Variable()
	obj = square(x)
	for i=1:10
		p = minimize(obj, x >= i)
		solve!(p, SCSSolver())
	end

Warmstarts, Parameters, Fixing and Freeing Variables
****************************************************

If you're solving many problems of the same form, or many similar problems,
you may also want to use warmstarts, or to dynamically fix and free variables.
The former is particularly good for a family of problems related by a parameter;
the latter allows for easy implementation of alternating minimization for 
nonconvex problems. See the `Advanced Features <advanced.html>`_ section of the documentation for more information.
