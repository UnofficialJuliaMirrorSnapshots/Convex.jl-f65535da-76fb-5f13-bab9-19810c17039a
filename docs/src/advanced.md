Advanced Features
=================

Dual Variables
--------------

Convex.jl also returns the optimal dual variables for a problem. These
are stored in the `dual` field associated with each constraint.

```julia
using Convex, SCS

x = Variable()
constraint = x >= 0
p = minimize(x, constraint)
solve!(p, SCSSolver())

# Get the dual value for the constraint
p.constraints[1].dual
# or
constraint.dual
```

Warmstarting
------------

If you're solving the same problem many times with different values of
a parameter, Convex.jl can initialize many solvers with the solution to
the previous problem, which sometimes speeds up the solution time. This
is called a **warm start**.

To use this feature, pass the optional argument
`warmstart=true` to the `solve!` method.

```julia
# initialize data
n = 1000
y = rand(n)
x = Variable(n)

# first solve
lambda = 100
problem = minimize(sumsquares(y - x) + lambda * sumsquares(x - 10))
@time solve!(problem, SCSSolver())

# now warmstart
# if the solver takes advantage of warmstarts, 
# this run will be faster
lambda = 105
@time solve!(problem, SCSSolver(), warmstart=true)
```

Fixing and freeing variables
----------------------------

Convex.jl allows you to fix a variable `x` to a value by
calling the `fix!` method. Fixing the variable essentially
turns it into a constant. Fixed variables are sometimes also called
parameters.

`fix!(x, v)` fixes the variable `x` to the value
`v`.

`fix!(x)` fixes `x` to the value
`x.value`, which might be the value obtained by solving
another problem involving the variable `x`.

To allow the variable `x` to vary again, call
`free!(x)`.

Fixing and freeing variables can be particularly useful as a tool for
performing alternating minimization on nonconvex problems. For example,
we can find an approximate solution to a nonnegative matrix
factorization problem with alternating minimization as follows. We use
warmstarts to speed up the solution.

```julia
# initialize nonconvex problem
n, k = 10, 1
A = rand(n, k) * rand(k, n)
x = Variable(n, k)
y = Variable(k, n)
problem = minimize(sum_squares(A - x*y), x>=0, y>=0)

# initialize value of y
y.value = rand(k, n)
# we'll do 10 iterations of alternating minimization
for i=1:10 
    # first solve for x
    # with y fixed, the problem is convex
    fix!(y)
    solve!(problem, SCSSolver(), warmstart = i > 1 ? true : false)
    free!(y)

    # now solve for y with x fixed at the previous solution
    fix!(x)
    solve!(problem, SCSSolver(), warmstart = true)
    free!(x)
end
```

Printing and the tree structure
-------------------------------

A Convex problem is structured as a *tree*, with the *root* being the
problem object, with branches to the objective and the set of constraints.
The objective is an `AbstractExpr` which itself is a tree, with each atom
being a node and having `children` which are other atoms, variables, or
constants. Convex provides `children` methods from
[AbstractTrees.jl](https://github.com/Keno/AbstractTrees.jl) so that the
tree-traversal functions of that package can be used with Convex.jl problems
and structures. This is what allows powers the printing of problems, expressions,
and constraints. The depth to which the tree corresponding to a problem,
expression, or constraint is printed is controlled by the global variable
`MAXDEPTH`, which defaults to 3. This can be changed by e.g. setting

```julia
Convex.MAXDEPTH[] = 5
```

The AbstractTrees methods can also be used to analyze the structure
of a Convex.jl problem. For example,

```@repl 1
using Convex, AbstractTrees
x = Variable()
p = maximize( log(x), x >= 1, x <= 3 )
for leaf in AbstractTrees.Leaves(p)
    println("Here's a leaf: $(summary(leaf))")
end
```

We can also iterate over the problem in various orders. The following descriptions
are taken from the AbstractTrees.jl docstrings, which have more information.

### PostOrderDFS

Iterator to visit the nodes of a tree, guaranteeing that children
will be visited before their parents.

```@repl 1
for (i, node) in enumerate(AbstractTrees.PostOrderDFS(p))
    println("Here's node $i via PostOrderDFS: $(summary(node))")
end
```

### PreOrderDFS

Iterator to visit the nodes of a tree, guaranteeing that parents
will be visited before their children.

```@repl 1
for (i, node) in enumerate(AbstractTrees.PreOrderDFS(p))
    println("Here's node $i via PreOrderDFS: $(summary(node))")
end
```

### StatelessBFS

Iterator to visit the nodes of a tree, guaranteeing that all nodes of a level
will be visited before their children.

```@repl 1
for (i, node) in enumerate(AbstractTrees.StatelessBFS(p))
    println("Here's node $i via StatelessBFS: $(summary(node))")
end
```
